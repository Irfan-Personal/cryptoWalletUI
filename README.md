## Troubleshooting XCode 15.3 Update Issues

If you're upgrading to XCode 15.3 and encounter build errors related to Flipper or Yoga layout engine in your React Native project, here are the steps to resolve these issues:

### Error: Called object type 'facebook::flipper::SocketCertificateProvider' is not a function or function pointer

This error occurs due to a missing include directive in the Flipper library. To resolve this, you need to manually add an include directive to a specific file in the Flipper dependency.

**Fix:**
1. Open `ios/Pods/Flipper/xplat/Flipper/FlipperTransportTypes.h` in your project directory.
2. Navigate to line 9.
3. Add the following line of code:
   ```cpp
   #include <functional>
   ```
4. Save the file and rebuild your project in XCode.

This addition ensures the proper C++ standard library header is included, resolving the compile-time error related to `facebook::flipper::SocketCertificateProvider`.

### Error: Incompatible function pointer types passing 'YGSize

This error is related to an incompatibility in the Yoga layout engine used by React Native. It usually manifests when attempting to compile the project after updating to XCode 15.3.

**Fix:**
We have included a patch in the project to address this issue. You simply need to apply the patch using the `patch-package` command. Follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have `patch-package` installed in your project. If not, you can add it by running:
   ```bash
   npm install patch-package postinstall-postinstall --save-dev
   ```
   or if you use Yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn add patch-package postinstall-postinstall --dev
   ```

2. Run the patch-package command to apply the patch:
   ```bash
   npx patch-package
   ```
   or if you use Yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn patch-package
   ```

3. Rebuild your project in XCode.

These steps should resolve the compilation error and allow your project to build successfully with XCode 15.3. If you encounter any further issues, please check if there are any updates to this guide or consult the community for more recent fixes.
